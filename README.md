## Summary

The analysis shows that the vast majority of riders ride for less than an hour and a most for less than a half hour. Men ride for longer than women and when comparing to the times that they ride, it is apparent that men feel more comfortable riding early in the morning or late at night. Most people that used Citibike were subscribers and rush hour was typically the busiest time for rentals. Saturday and Sunday during the day have a notable increase in usage as well. Additional visualizations that would be useful could include mapping weather data to determine its' effects, or looking at the frequency of use of different bike stations.
